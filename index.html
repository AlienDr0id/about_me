        About Me
      </p>
      <P>
        I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student at Illinois institute of
        Technology in Chicago, IL. I am very passionate about engineering and science.
        For as long as I can remember I have had a very curious and experimental nature.
        Creating, breaking down, and understanding things has always been my hobby. I
        believe being an engineer is not just a career, it means being creative, being a
        volunteer, and providing sustainable solutions to daily problems.
